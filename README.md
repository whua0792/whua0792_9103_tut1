## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration
I found the imaging technique of stained-glass effects to be a good inspiration for our major assignment. This technique is inspired by the stained-glass windows of __Barcelona’s La Sagrada Familia cathedral__, which is world-famous. Stained-glass effects emphasize bold lines and well-defined areas, which can help to divide the canvas into different, easily recognizable sections. This corresponds to the characteristics of _Pacita Abad's 'Wheels of Fortune'_ that our group wanted to choose, which can show its bright colors, clear boundaries between shapes, and complex geometric patterns.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
For the coding technique, I considered using __Perlin noise__ to animate colors or shapes in a smooth, organic way. Perlin noise changes smoothly over time, making it well suited to creating natural, flowing changes in color or position for parts of stained glass inspired artwork, visually presenting the gradual change of texture and color in stained glass.
